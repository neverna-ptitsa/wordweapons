My inaugural post is on a delightful word: _Enthymeme_.

Today someone said to me, _"He was raised in a Morman cult. Need I say more?"_
The person with 
whom I was speaking had not outlined what they were thinking, and
I had no idea in what sense she meant her question.
The answer in the particular situation was an obvious "yes."

The expectation on their part (I expect) was that I would say "oh yes, of course." 
In such a situation I could be saying "of course" to almost anything though; 
the argument hadn't been well specified and relied on the audience (me) to infer 
what the speaker meant. 

Sometimes this is reasonable; if the statement on offer is a truism that is universally
understood in a culture, then there is no need to fully outline one's
thoughts. But if it is not, then this would at first seem to be an error
on the part of the speaker. He has failed to relate his thoughts to his
audience in any way that ensures consistent understanding and discourse.

I think within the last year or two, this seeming error has become an increasingly
common rhetorical technique. The effectiveness of the technique arises from
the fact that everyone hearing an incomplete proposition can infer 
anything that they might wish.
 
Imagine a room where someone employs this technique on an eager audience.
A speaker blurts out an incomplete thought: "She gets funding from Wall St.
Need I say more?" As heads bob up and down throughout the
room in agreement, a sense of oneness spreads where none
exists. 

Our own president Donald Trump uses this technique to tremendous
effect; indeed his effective use of the technique is likely the source of
my perception that it has become more commonplace.

Consider the following possible interpretations of the above question:

```
He was raised in a mormon cult.
Mormon cults practice polygamy.
Polygamy is bad.
Therefore mormon cults are bad.
```

or

```
He was raised in a mormon cult.
Mormon is colloquial term for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (CJCLS)
CJCLDS members believe in moral behavior.
Moral behavior is good.
Therefore mormon cults are good.
```

or

```
He was raised in a mormon cult.
Mormon cults are involved in making textiles.
Therefore he makes textiles.
```

_(Note: the three statements above are designed to describe the variety of presuppositions
that the original proposition might relate to and not to draw attention to the particular
propositions themselves)_

One's feelings relative to the president aside, this is clearly
not a good thing for daily discourse. In the context presented to me today,
it was not helpful to the cause of my companion because there was
no chance I could be cowed into nodding my head in ambiguous agreement during
a conversation involving only two speakers. In a broader context, this is
a fairly toxic technique that is only useful for establishing and maintaining
confusion.

Enthymemes are a useful element of a mind virus. Some original huckster
kicks off an unsubstantiated claim, and his followers parrot it in the same
way in their own social circles. With this simple trick a large number of people can nod their 
heads in agreement to nothing while enjoying the sense of safety and well
being that accompany being part of a greater whole. The victims of the
enthymeme believe they are in agreement, however they are not. The person
who controls the completion of the thought on offer can now exercise tremendous
control over his audience.

In the most benign case, this can result in a thought that never gets completed.
Those who are bought in may argue unproductively with each other over the intended
meaning, or they may just ignore the discrepancy and carry on in a confusion of
arbitrary thought and action.

The effect can also be more sinister, making it easy to goat others into radical
beliefs. Imagine that the original completes their thought; if someone now wishes
to refute the complete proposition, that carries a feeling of loss of community.
Because the audience wishes to avoid appearing mutually ignorant of the speaker's
original intent, the progenitor of the mind virus can hold their audience captive to
his future interpretation of the original statement.

Reinforcing a sense of agreement between individuals who are not actually in
agreement seems toxic to the foundations of a lot of things that are quite
popular, such as:

- Information economies
- Democratic society
- Personal choice

If we wish to freely trade in ideas this will not work. 
If we wish to hold democratic elections, this will not work. If we wish to make almost
any choice for ourselves, this will not work. If you simply get a large enough group of people
who want to belong in a room together for a short period of time, a skilled 
silver-tongued rascal can hold them captive indefinitely.

This idea is so toxic and threatening that it is worth naming so that one can identify it,
relate that identification, and target it. I had a few words in mind 
that were close but did not meet my intent:

- __Non-sequitur__: close, but the statement seemed to make more sense than the typical
  complete and unambiguous disconnection of logic offered by a non-sequitur. For example,
  "I am a radish, therefore I drink milk" is a non-sequitur because there is no implied
  knowledge at hand. The statement is complete in its falseness and ridicule, whereas 
  enthymemes are not complete or obvious in their flawedness.
- __Emperor's new clothes__: a useful cautionary tale in describing this and other phenomenon but
  limited in practicality because of the mental leap needed to make the
  association each time the phrase is used.
- __Dangling Participle and Incomplete Sentence__: close, but intended for
  errors made at the syntactic level of speech. These terms don't really describe errors
  of logic.
  
Some Googling finally led me to [this excellent discussion](http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/enthy.html)
from Lander University's philosophy department. To me, the word seems to foot the bill,
although it may not emphasize the same negative connotation that I am attempting to, I 
think that in itself may be of use as well in avoiding escalating criticism of other's thoughts.
