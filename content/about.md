The world of online discourse has reached a fevered pitch: rather than speaking to one
another, we have begun to speak past one another at a furious pace. My sense in
observing social media is that this is often the result of a lack of words to express
one's thoughts; or, in more extreme cases, the lack of archetypal concepts to which to
assign events.

My goal in publishing this blog is to arm anyone who cares to read it with the words
and concepts that I feel are serving me well today. As a human, I think it is inevitable
that I will discuss my thoughts in terms of my perspective be it a political, cultural,
or socioeconomic one.

But I do hope that regardless of my readers' perspectives that the thoughts on offer
are taken as well meaning, with the intent of being politically inert. While
I certainly do offer thoughts to others with the hope they will adopt them, I also
harbor a hope that others will use the tools of language (even those I offer here) 
to convince me of ideas which I am now resistant to.

This is actually the basis of civil discourse: the desire both to convince and be convinced,
then to yield easily on either side when reason and agreement reach each other. Anyone who's
spent a modicum of time on Facebook or Twitter recently knows we couldn't be living in a
world more opposite.

Of course if we are all confused or unable to name or understand the things we are thinking,
such efforts will inevitably fail.
