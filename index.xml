      <description>The world of online discourse has reached a fevered pitch: rather than speaking to one another, we have begun to speak past one another at a furious pace. My sense in observing social media is that this is often the result of a lack of words to express one&amp;rsquo;s thoughts; or, in more extreme cases, the lack of archetypal concepts to which to assign events.
My goal in publishing this blog is to arm anyone who cares to read it with the words and concepts that I feel are serving me well today.</description>

Need I say more?&amp;rdquo; The person with whom I was speaking had not outlined what they were thinking, and I had no idea in what sense she meant her question. The answer in the particular situation was an obvious &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
The expectation on their part (I expect) was that I would say &amp;ldquo;oh yes, of course.</description>
